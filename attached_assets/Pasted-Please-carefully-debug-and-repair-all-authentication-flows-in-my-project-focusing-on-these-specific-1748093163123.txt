Please carefully debug and repair all authentication flows in my project, focusing on these specific files:

- `src/features/auth/authSlice.ts` (Redux slice for auth state, token handling, login/logout/register actions)
- `src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.tsx` (Login UI/form, validation, RTK Query/thunk trigger, error UI)
- `src/features/auth/components/SignupForm.tsx` (Signup UI/form, validation, RTK Query/thunk trigger, error UI)
- `src/layout/Header.tsx` or `src/components/Header.tsx` (Logout button, triggers logout, role switch, and navigation)
- `src/features/auth/api.ts` or similar (RTK Query endpoints for login, register, logout)
- `src/features/auth/utils.ts` (any helpers for localStorage/session or token decode)
- `src/app/ProtectedRoute.tsx` (Protected route logic)
- All other files directly used by these

**The expected correct flow is:**

**Signup**
- User fills out and submits signup form.
- Calls `/api/auth/signup` endpoint.
- On success: show toast "Registration successful. Please sign in.", redirect to login, do NOT auto-login.
- On error: show error message, do NOT clear form.

**Login**
- User fills out and submits login form.
- Calls `/api/auth/login` endpoint.
- On success: set auth state (user, token, role, isAuthenticated) in Redux, persist in localStorage, redirect to dashboard/protected route, show toast.
- On error: show error message, keep form values.

**Logout**
- Clicking logout in header triggers Redux logout, clears all tokens/auth from state and storage, redirects to login, shows toast.
- After logout, protected routes redirect to login.

**Debug and Repair:**
- Audit every auth-related file above for:
  - Form state and validation errors
  - RTK Query/thunk handling (loading, success, error)
  - Redux auth state updates and localStorage persistence
  - Proper redirects (useNavigate from react-router)
  - Working logout (Redux + storage clear)
  - Correct error messages and toasts for all flows
  - ProtectedRoute correctly blocking non-authenticated users

**Testing/Verification:**
- Register, login, logout work as expected.
- User can see dashboard only when logged in.
- After logout, all protected pages redirect to login.
- No other features/routes break.

**Documentation:**
- Add or update README in `src/features/auth/` with:
  - Auth flow description
  - Troubleshooting for common bugs
  - How to extend or test

**IMPORTANT:**  
Do NOT rewrite or affect code ou
