I want you to generate a comprehensive, enterprise-level technical documentation file for the codebase you built so far, covering Parts 1 to 17 as per our instructions.

**This documentation must include:**

1. **Project Overview:**
   - What is the app about? (E-commerce + content + admin, FAANG-level, scalable)
   - Which tech stack is used and why (React.js, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit + RTK Query, Tailwind CSS, etc.)
   - How features are architected to plug into a single global app shell, store, router, and UI provider stack.

2. **Folder Structure Explained:**
   - List every top-level folder and its purpose (app, features, ui, layout, utils, types, styles, tests, __mocks__, index.tsx)
   - Describe the role and integration point of every subfolder (auth, products, cart, orders, dashboard, admin, profile, reviews, content, etc.)
   - Confirm every folder/subfolder has barrels and uses absolute imports.

3. **Redux Toolkit State Management:**
   - List all feature slices and RTK Query endpoints created (auth, products, cart, orders, dashboard, admin, profile, reviews, notifications, etc.)
   - Show how global state is composed, typed, persisted (localStorage), and how async flows (RTK Query/thunks) are wired up.
   - Detail how role-based access (RBAC), toasts, modals, notifications, and UI state are all Redux-managed.

4. **Routing & Navigation:**
   - How the global router (React Router v6+) is set up
   - Nested routes, protected routes, RBAC controls, lazy-loading where used
   - Sidebar/menu config and how it adapts for roles and devices

5. **UI System:**
   - Describe how all UI primitives (modals, toasts, dropdowns, tabs, skeleton, error boundary) are global, accessible, and Redux-driven
   - How forms, dialogs, notifications are standardized
   - Theme system (dark/light mode, persisted via Redux/localStorage)

6. **Features and Flows (For Each Major Feature up to Part 17):**
   - Auth (login, signup, RBAC, SSO/social, protected routes, role switching)
   - Products (search, filter, grid, sort, infinite scroll, detail/builder)
   - Cart & Wishlist (multi-seller, guest/user, persistence, promo, etc)
   - Orders (history, returns, tracking, invoices, polling)
   - Profile & Preferences (avatar, 2FA, settings, accessibility)
   - Reviews/Community (reviews, upvotes, replies, abuse, moderation)
   - Dashboard & Analytics (charts, widgets, role-aware analytics)
   - Admin (CRUD, roles, logs, impersonation, settings)
   - Content/Media (CMS, banners, video player, categories)
   - Notifications (system/user, toasts, queue, ARIA)
   - Delivery/Logistics (address, tracking, ETA, geocode, etc)
   - Help/Support (FAQ, tickets, chat, escalation, live agent)
   - Accessibility (a11y patterns, ARIA, keyboard navigation, color contrast, responsive design)

7. **Utilities & Types:**
   - List all custom hooks, utils, validators, logger, debounce/throttle, API, analytics, localStorage/session, date/time utilities
   - Explain centralized types/interfaces and how every slice/component uses them

8. **Testing & Coverage:**
   - Overview of all unit/integration tests per feature (__tests__ folder), global mocks (MSW), and test coverage achieved so far
   - Lint, Prettier, strict TypeScript config, scripts present

9. **CI, DevOps, and Deployment:**
   - CI pipeline/scripts present (if up to that part)
   - What’s needed to run/build/test/deploy (list all scripts)
   - How to clone/zip and get started locally (step-by-step)

10. **Roadmap/What’s Next:**
    - List which advanced features (Payments, more analytics, advanced admin, future DevOps/monitoring, etc.) are *not* yet implemented (Parts 18–22)
    - Show how the app can be extended, and why it’s easy to onboard/fork for future teams

**Format this as a professional Markdown/README.md or architecture book.
Make it clear, detailed, and ready for technical reviewers or onboarding.**
