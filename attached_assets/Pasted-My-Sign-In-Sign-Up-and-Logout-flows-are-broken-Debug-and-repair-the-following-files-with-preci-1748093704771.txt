My Sign In, Sign Up, and Logout flows are broken.  
Debug and repair the following files with precision. DO NOT touch unrelated features.

1. **src/features/auth/authSlice.ts**
   - On login success: set `isAuthenticated: true`, save user/role/token, and persist to localStorage.
   - On signup: DO NOT auto-login; after success, redirect to login and show a success toast.
   - On logout: clear user, token, isAuthenticated in state and all relevant storage.
   - On any error: set error field in state for UI to read. Clear error on successful login/signup.
   - Make sure all async thunks/mutations handle `loading`, `success`, `error` correctly.

2. **src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.tsx**
   - Use React Hook Form or fully controlled state, strict TS types.
   - On submit: dispatch login (RTK Query mutation or thunk).
   - On success: redirect to dashboard/protected page and show a toast.
   - On error: show clear error message; do not clear user-entered values.
   - Always show field validation errors (required, email format, min password length).

3. **src/features/auth/components/SignupForm.tsx**
   - Same standards as LoginForm.
   - On submit: dispatch signup mutation.
   - On success: show "Registration successful" toast and redirect to login page.
   - Do NOT auto-login.
   - On error: show server error.

4. **src/features/auth/api.ts**
   - Ensure login, signup, and logout endpoints return errors in a way the UI can display (not just status 500).
   - On login success, return JWT and user/role; on signup, just success or error.
   - Parse and store tokens/roles only after successful login.

5. **src/features/auth/utils.ts**
   - Implement reliable set, get, and clear methods for user/token in storage.
   - On logout, clear ALL relevant keys.

6. **src/layout/Header.tsx** (or `src/components/Header.tsx`)
   - Logout button: dispatch logout action, clear all local/session storage, redirect to login, show "Logged out" toast.
   - After logout, header/nav should show login/signup (not user menu).

7. **src/app/ProtectedRoute.tsx**
   - Must read `isAuthenticated` from Redux.
   - If NOT authenticated, redirect to `/login` using navigate.
   - Only authenticated users access protected routes.

**Testing:**
- User can sign up, see toast, be redirected to login (not auto-logged in).
- User can login, see welcome toast, reach dashboard.
- User can logout, be redirected to login, see "logged out" toast.
- Protected pages block if not logged in.
- All storage/state are cleared after logout.
- Errors and validation are always visible.
- All other app features remain unaffected.

**Documentation:**
- Update README in `src/features/auth/` to explain the correct flow, how to debug, and extend.
