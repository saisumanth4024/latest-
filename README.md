# Enterprise React Application - Technical Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

### Introduction
This application is a comprehensive enterprise-grade e-commerce platform that integrates content management and administrative capabilities. It follows industry-standard architecture patterns inspired by large-scale applications developed at leading technology companies.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for efficient API data fetching
- **UI & Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/UI components
- **Authentication**: Replit OpenID Connect with custom role-based access control
- **Routing**: wouter for lightweight, hooks-based routing
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM

### Architectural Philosophy
The application is built on a monolithic frontend architecture where all features plug into:
- One global Redux store
- One global router
- One UI/layout provider stack
- One global app shell

This approach ensures a consistent user experience, simplified state management, and better maintainability across the codebase. Every feature is designed to be a self-contained module that integrates with the core application architecture through standardized patterns.

### Feature Module Organization

Each feature in the `features/` directory follows a consistent structure:

```
feature/
├── components/          # Feature-specific UI components
├── api/                 # RTK Query API definitions
├── hooks/               # Feature-specific hooks
├── utils/               # Feature-specific utilities
├── types/               # Feature-specific type definitions
├── [feature]Slice.ts    # Redux slice for state management
└── index.ts             # Barrel export file
```

All imports use absolute paths via the `@/` prefix, facilitating easier refactoring and improved code navigation.

## 3. Redux Toolkit State Management

### Store Configuration

The application uses a centralized Redux store configured in `app/store.ts`, combining:

- Feature-specific slices (auth, products, cart, orders, etc.)
- API middleware from RTK Query
- Serialization and development tools

### Feature Slices

The application includes the following key slices:

- **Auth**: User authentication state, roles, and permissions
- **Products**: Product catalog state, filters, and search
- **Cart**: Shopping cart items, totals, and checkout flow
- **Orders**: Order history, tracking, and management
- **Wishlist**: Saved items for future purchase
- **Dashboard**: Analytics and reporting data
- **Search**: Global search state, filters, and history
- **UI**: Global UI state (modals, toasts, theme)
- **Notifications**: System and user notifications
- **Profile**: User profile and preferences

### RTK Query APIs

API interactions are managed through RTK Query endpoints organized by domain:

- **Auth API**: User authentication and authorization
- **Products API**: Product catalog and inventory
- **Orders API**: Order creation and management
- **Dashboard API**: Analytics and reporting data
- **Metrics API**: System performance metrics

### State Persistence

Selected portions of the state are persisted to localStorage using standard browser APIs:

```typescript
// Example from a slice
export const saveToLocalStorage = createAsyncThunk(
  'feature/saveToLocalStorage',
  async (_, { getState }) => {
    const state = getState() as RootState;
    window.localStorage.setItem('featureData', JSON.stringify(state.feature));
  }
);
```

### Role-Based Access Control

The application implements role-based access control through the auth slice, which:

- Tracks the current user's role
- Provides selectors to check permissions
- Controls access to routes and UI elements based on roles

## 4. Routing & Navigation

### Router Setup

The application uses wouter for routing, configured in `App.tsx`:

```typescript
function AppRouter() {
  const { isAuthenticated, isLoading } = useAuth();

  return (
    <Switch>
      {isLoading || !isAuthenticated ? (
        <Route path="/" component={Landing} />
      ) : (
        <>
          <Route path="/" component={Home} />
          <Route path="/dashboard" component={Dashboard} />
          <Route path="/products" component={Products} />
          {/* Additional routes */}
        </>
      )}
      <Route component={NotFound} />
    </Switch>
  );
}
```

### Protected Routes

Protected routes are implemented using a custom `ProtectedRoute` component that:

- Checks the user's authentication status
- Verifies the user has the required role(s)
- Redirects to the login page or displays an unauthorized message

### Navigation Configuration

Navigation items are defined in a centralized configuration:

```typescript
export interface NavItem {
  title: string;
  path: string;
  icon: string;
  roles: UserRole[];
  children?: NavItem[];
}

export const navigation: NavSection[] = [
  {
    title: 'Main',
    items: [
      {
        title: 'Dashboard',
        path: '/dashboard',
        icon: ICONS.dashboard,
        roles: ['user', 'admin', 'seller']
      },
      // Additional items
    ]
  },
  // Additional sections
];
```

This configuration is filtered based on the user's role to display only relevant navigation items.

## 5. UI System

### Component Library

The application uses a combination of custom components and shadcn/UI components, all styled with Tailwind CSS. Key UI components include:

- **Layout**: Header, Sidebar, Footer
- **Feedback**: Toast, Modal, Skeleton, ErrorBoundary
- **Inputs**: Form, Input, Select, Checkbox, RadioGroup
- **Display**: Card, Table, Badge, Avatar
- **Navigation**: Tabs, Breadcrumbs, Pagination

### Theme System

The application supports both light and dark modes:

```typescript
export function ThemeProvider({ children }: ThemeProviderProps) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>(() => {
    // Check for saved theme preference
    const storedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
    if (storedTheme === 'dark' || storedTheme === 'light') return storedTheme as Theme;
    
    // Use system preference as fallback
    return window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches ? 'dark' : 'light';
  });
  
  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme(prev => (prev === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
  };
  
  // Apply theme class to document
  useEffect(() => {
    if (theme === 'dark') {
      document.documentElement.classList.add('dark');
    } else {
      document.documentElement.classList.remove('dark');
    }
    
    // Save user preference
    localStorage.setItem('theme', theme);
  }, [theme]);
  
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, toggleTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

### Global UI State

UI elements like modals and toasts are managed through Redux:

```typescript
// Toast example
export const useToast = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  
  const toast = (props: Toast) => {
    dispatch(showToast(props));
  };
  
  const success = (props: Omit<Toast, 'variant'>) => {
    toast({ ...props, variant: 'success' });
  };
  
  const error = (props: Omit<Toast, 'variant'>) => {
    toast({ ...props, variant: 'error' });
  };
  
  // Additional helper methods
  
  return { toast, success, error, /* ... */ };
};
```

## 6. Features and Flows

### TypeScript Types

The type system is built on a foundation of shared interfaces:

```typescript
// Database schema types (shared/schema.ts)
export type User = typeof users.$inferSelect;
export type UpsertUser = typeof users.$inferInsert;

// Feature-specific types
export interface SearchState {
  query: string;
  filters: ProductFilters;
  // Additional properties
}

export interface CartItem {
  id: string | number;
  productId: string | number;
  quantity: number;
  // Additional properties
}
```

These types ensure consistency across the application and provide strong typing for Redux state, API responses, and UI components.
